            <h3><u>My review:</u></h3>
            <p>NO SPOILERS!
                Venturing into the biography genre for the first time, I encountered a compelling LGBTQ+ narrative that revolves around a character named "Evelyn Hugo." Initially, I entertained the notion of her being a real person, only to discover speculations linking her story to the 90s actress "Elizabeth Taylor." Despite my initial lack of interest in biographies, the exceptional writing in this book proved to be a game-changer.
                
                The narrative leans towards a more feminine perspective, unfolding the life of "Evelyn Hugo" and her relationships with seven husbands, interwoven with significant LGBTQ+ themes. The book sheds light on the harsh realities faced by celebrities in the 90s, providing a poignant reflection on their journey to stardom. The 90s setting adds a contextual layer that enhances the overall narrative, aligning with my personal fondness for 90s Hollywood celebrities.
                
                The captivating writing style ensured that the story never became dull, and my admiration for the book extended to the point where the existence of a real-life "Evelyn Hugo" seemed plausible. I highly recommend this biography, especially if you're open to exploring LGBTQ+ narratives within the context of Hollywood's glamorous yet challenging landscape.</p>

                <h3><u>My review:</u></h3>
                <p>"The Song of Achilles" by Madeline Miller**

                    I recently emerged from a reading slump and stumbled upon a gem that reignited my love for literature – "The Song of Achilles" by Madeline Miller. From the moment I turned the first page, I was utterly captivated by Miller's lyrical prose and masterful storytelling.
                    
                    "The Song of Achilles" is a poignant retelling of the timeless tale of Achilles and Patroclus, set against the backdrop of the Trojan War. Miller weaves together elements of fiction, mythology, and romance with such finesse that I found myself completely immersed in the world she created.
                    
                    One of the book's greatest strengths lies in its characterization. Achilles and Patroclus, the central figures of the narrative, are brought to life with such depth and complexity that they felt like dear friends by the end of the story. Their bond, portrayed with tender nuance, transcends the boundaries of friendship and evolves into a love that is both heart-wrenching and sublime.
                    
                    As someone who gravitates towards stories that evoke emotion, I was deeply moved by the profound sense of longing and vulnerability that permeates the pages of this book. Miller's portrayal of love, loss, and sacrifice is nothing short of exquisite, leaving a lasting impression that lingers long after the final chapter.
                    
                    The fusion of mythology and history adds an extra layer of richness to the narrative, offering fresh insights into familiar legends while remaining true to the essence of the original myths. Miller's meticulous research is evident in every detail, from the vibrant tapestry of ancient Greece to the epic battles that shape the fate of heroes.
                    
                    I devoured "The Song of Achilles" in a mere two days, unable to tear myself away from its spellbinding narrative. The beautifully crafted prose, coupled with the unforgettable characters and poignant themes, left me breathless and yearning for more.
                    
                    In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend "The Song of Achilles" to anyone seeking a captivating tale that transcends time and genre. Whether you're a fan of mythology, romance, or simply great storytelling, this book is sure to leave an indelible mark on your heart. Prepare to be swept away on an unforgettable journey of love, honor, and the power of the human spirit. </p>

                   <h3><u>My review:</u></h3>
                   <p>This captivating book, reminiscent of the emotional resonance found in "Before the Coffee Gets Cold," initially unfolds with a somber tone centered around the protagonist, Nora Seed. As the narrative progresses, it beautifully transitions into a tale of resilience and hope, revealing how Nora confronts and overcomes the challenges that weigh heavily on her life. Despite the initial despair, the story subtly imparts a profound message—that even in the darkest moments, there exists a glimmer of positivity awaiting discovery.

                    This poignant narrative not only delves into Nora's struggles but also serves as a powerful reminder that, regardless of life's adversities, there is always a potential for positive transformation. The book resonates deeply with readers by addressing the often-stigmatized topic of mental health, offering comfort through the lens of literature. In an era where discussions surrounding mental health are crucial yet not normalized, this book serves as a beacon, providing solace and understanding.
                    
                    I enthusiastically recommend this book for anyone grappling with feelings of sorrow or a sense of hopelessness. Its narrative is not just a source of motivation but also a profound teacher, guiding readers to rediscover the meaning in their own lives through Nora Seed's transformative journey.</p>

                    <h3><u>My Review:</u></h3>
                    <p>This book completely shattered me, but it’s also the most incredible story I’ve ever read. I feel like I lived every moment with the characters, and now I just want to reach out and hug them. Writing this review through tears, I’m trying to keep it as honest as possible. I won’t give away any spoilers, but I will say that Jude and Willem stole my heart. I thought I’d have a lot to say, but now I’m struggling to find the words.

                        Yes, this book is intense, dark, and sometimes terrifying, but the connections between the characters and the powerful writing make it unforgettable. So many moments struck close to home and moved me to tears repeatedly. It took me over a month to finish, but I’m grateful I did. I’ll hold this story close and cherish it forever.
                        
                        If you’re able to handle heavy themes, I highly recommend it. Please make sure to read the trigger warnings beforehand, but trust me—you won’t regret reading this masterpiece.</p>

                        <p>Where do I even start? The book begins with the first chapter about fumiko who fought with goro(her bf) before he left to america then she comes across this cafe where one can go to the past but the twist here is they cannot change their present/future no matter what but when they time travel back to their past they need to follow a bunch of rules.. the book takes a roller coaster at every step as deep you get into the book you start attaching yourself with the characters because is every chapter there is a different story of different people. I got too attached to the characters and had a huge feeling that I was present right at that cafe and seeing all of it which was written on the book . This is my first time read a book of this genre. It left me crying after I read this book I was in happy tears i mean I had that satisfied feeling once I completed reading the book. Definitely give it a try you all will love it for sure
                            Ps: This is my first writing a book review so please excuse my vocabulary or any of such</p>
